                             /* IIFE : IMMEDIATELY Invoked Function Execution */                

Immedialety invoked Function Expression (iife) are JavaScripts Functions that are executed immediately.
They are typically used to create a localScope for Variables to present them from polluting the global scope.

Explanation : The Function is wrapped in paranthesis (function (){.....}) followed by () to immediately invoked it.

Example : (function addTwo(){                                      First Paranthesis         
            return num1+num2;                                       ^
                        })                                          |
          (Console.log(3+5)).                                      ( )                ( ) : Second Paranthesis

 # Global scope ke pollution se problem hoti hai kai bar to usGlobal scope ke jo variable hai uske polution ko hatanre ke liye.
 # This COuld also Works inn Arrow Functions.



 Example :  // Here, we're defining a variable `ans` and assigning it the result of an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).
            let ans = (function abcd() {
           // Inside the IIFE, we define a local variable `a` with the initial value of 12.
           var a = 12;
 
          // The function returns an object with two methods: `set` and `get`.
          return {
          // `set` method: It accepts a parameter `val` and assigns it to the variable `a`.
          set: function(val) {
          a = val; // This updates the value of `a` to whatever value is passed to `set()`.
          },
          // `get` method: It logs the current value of `a` to the console.
          get: function() {
          console.log(a); // This prints the current value of `a` to the console.
         },
         };
         })();

// The `set` method is now called with the argument `"32"`, which will change the value of `a` to "32".
ans.set("32");

// Now, the `get` method is called. It will print the current value of `a`, which is now `"32"`.
ans.get(); // Output: "32"

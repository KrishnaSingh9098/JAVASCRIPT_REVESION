✅ In English

Array.from() only works on:

Array-like objects (objects with a length property), or

Iterable objects (like arrays, strings, maps, sets)

Your object:

{ Name: "Krishna" }


❌ is not iterable
❌ does not have a length property

So JavaScript treats it as an array-like object with:

length === undefined (or 0)


👉 Result: empty array []

That’s why the output is:

[]




 👉 If you want values:

 Array.from(Object.values({ Name: "Krishna" }))
// ["Krishna"]


👉 If you want keys:

Array.from(Object.keys({ Name: "Krishna" }))
// ["Name"]


👉 If you want entries:

Array.from(Object.entries({ Name: "Krishna" }))
// [["Name", "Krishna"]]



🧠 Quick Tip

Array.from() ❌ ≠ “convert any object to array”
It only converts iterables or array-like objects.
